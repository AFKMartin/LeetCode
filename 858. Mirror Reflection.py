# https://leetcode.com/problems/mirror-reflection/description/
# There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls. Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered 0, 1, and 2.
# The square room has walls of length p and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance q from the 0th receptor.
# Given the two integers p and q, return the number of the receptor that the ray meets first.
# The test cases are guaranteed so that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.

# Example 1:

# Input: p = 2, q = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.
p = 6
q = 4

I thought it was like this at first. I will add a comment about this one for myself in the future since itâ€™s not that obvious, and I felt quite dumb with my first idea of the solution. Number theory is beautiful, but geometry really drives me crazy.

        if m % 2 == 1 and n % 2 == 1:
            return 0
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 1:
            return 1
